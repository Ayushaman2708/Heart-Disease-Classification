# Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project addresses the challenge of predicting the likelihood of an individual having a heart disease based on their health conditions. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset containing various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide the source or link to the dataset]. It consists of [number of instances] instances and [number of features] features. The target variable is whether the individual has a heart disease (1) or not (0).

# Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python (version 3.x)
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
# Installation
Clone the repository:
